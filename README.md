# Atholton Raider Time Management Website

A web application for managing raider time sessions at Atholton High School, built with Next.js and Django.
The website for managing raider time sessions at Atholton High School, built with Next.js for its access to shadcn and built in backend functionality and Django for backend

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for frontend)
    - Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- PostgreSQL 17+
    - Download PostgreSQL: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

## Frontend Setup

### Initial Setup
1. Make sure node.js is installed:
```bash
node -v  # Check Node.js version
npm -v   # Check npm version
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm run build   # Create production build
npm run start   # Start production server
npm audit       # Check for vulnerabilities
```

## Backend Setup

### PostgreSQL Installation
1. Download PostgreSQL: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
2. During installation:
   - Set a secure password for postgres user
   - Keep default port (5432)
   - Install all components when prompted

### Stack Builder Components
Install these additional components via Stack Builder:
1. psqlODBC (64 bit) - Database driver
2. pgAgent - For automated backups
3. pgBouncer - Connection pooling

### Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in project root with required settings (see `.env.example`)
2. Never commit `.env` file to git (always add in .gitignore, if it's already there then don't change it pls)
3. Generate a new Django secret key:
```python
# Run this one-liner in terminal to generate secure access key:
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

### Database Setup
1. Open pgAdmin 4
2. Create new database named 'atholton_test'
3. Run migrations:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
```

### Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv              # Create virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate            # Activate (Windows) (venv/bin/activate for Mac)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
```

### Django Commands
```bash
# Development
python manage.py runserver          # Start development server
python manage.py createsuperuser    # Create admin user
python manage.py makemigrations     # Create database migrations
python manage.py migrate           # Apply migrations

# Testing
python manage.py test              # Run all tests
python manage.py test backend.tests.test_env  # Run specific tests

# Static Files
python manage.py collectstatic     # Collect static files
```

## Project Structure

### Frontend (/frontend)
- `/pages` - Next.js pages and routing
- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/styles` - CSS and styling
- `/public` - Static assets

### Backend (/backend)
- `/accounts` - User authentication and profiles
- `/attendance` - Attendance tracking system
- `/backend` - Main Django configuration
- `/tests` - Test cases and stuff

## Development Workflow
1. Start PostgreSQL service
2. Start Django backend:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```
3. Start Next.js frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
4. Access:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Admin panel: http://localhost:8000/admin
   - API: http://localhost:8000/api/

## Testing
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test

# Backend
cd backend
python manage.py test
```

## Security Notes
- Keep `.env` file secure and never commit it PLEASE DONT
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regular security audits (npm audit)
- Keep dependencies updated:
```bash
# Update frontend dependencies
npm update        # Update packages within allowed ranges
npm outdated      # Check for outdated packages
npm audit fix     # Fix security vulnerabilities

# Update backend dependencies
pip list --outdated              # Check for outdated packages
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt  # Update all packages
```

## How it works

### The custom user model
- Created a custom User model that extends Django's AbstractUser
- Added role-based authentication with three roles:
  - ADMIN: School administrators
  - TEACHER: Teachers who manage raider times
  - STUDENT: Students who attend raider times
- Added school-specific fields for user profiles

### The attendance system
- Implemented a raider time attendance system
- Added functionality to track attendance for each raider time session
- Added functionality to view attendance for each raider time session

### Database Configuration
- Set up PostgreSQL as the database backend
- Database name: atholton_test
- Configured for:
  - Up to 2000 users (scalable)
  - Secure connections
  - Connection pooling via pgBouncer

### Testing Framework
- Environment variable tests:
  - Secret key length verification
  - Database connection testing
  - Security settings validation
- Test database configuration:
  - Automatic test database creation
  - Isolation from production data

### Authentication System
- I think it's now (somewhat) configured for school account integration
- Disabled email functionality since not needed
- Set up console backend for development logging
- Ready for school SSO integration
